    "## 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A research group at UBC Computer Science is gathering data on how people engage with video games. Specifically, player actions are recorded as they navigate through the virtual world of Minecraft in order to train AI models (with the end goal of creating smarter NPCs). However, managing this project is complex – as each participant is a volunteer, the team is seeking additional insights on how recruitment efforts could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our overarching goal is to analyze player behaviours and habits in search of useful information garnering participation. As highlighted by the project lead, Frank Wood, our mission is:\n",
    "> \"*To know more about the user populations: in particular, to have a good model of whether or not a player will continue contributing given* [their] *past participation*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these predictors can help in crafting strategies that not only improve participation rates but also ensure more representative, consistent data sampling throughout the course of the research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses a pivotal question in the context of ongoing research participation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Can committment to a project, as an abstract concept, be operationalized, modelled and thus predicted by training a model on past player data?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Our method uses KNN classification to create a model which can predict a player's commitment to longterm participation. A \"committed player\" is defined in this report as one that has continued partcipating for 2 or more weeks. The model works by taking two predictive variables - number of sessions and total hours of playtime - and classifying a player as \"committed\" or \"not interested\" based on the classification of players in its training data."

    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis utilizes two interconnected datasets hosted on Google Drive which together form the basis of this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset contains detailed profiles of the participants, including metrics that may influence their likelihood of continuing in the study, such as their demographic information, previous contributions to research, and initial level of Minecraft experience. Understanding the demographic and psychographic makeup of participants can help identify characteristics that correlate with sustained engagement."

These two variables alone will play a big role in determining play frequency in our model. The \"original_start_\" and \"_end_times\" are irrelevant for our purposes and can be discarded. Lastly, the emails will allow us connect information to specific users from the other dataset.\n",

    "## 3: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of each model is as follows :\n",
    "- Model 1 (number of sessions) accuracy is 95.4% with 2 false flags (1 false pos, 1 false neg)\n",
    "- Model 2 (return rate by days) accuracy is 88.6% with 5 false flags (3 false pos, 2 false neg)\n",
    "- Model 3 (return rate by plays) accuracy is 90.9% with 2 false flags (2 false pos, 2 false neg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall that false negatives are users that are engaged in reality but not identified as such by the predictive model, and false positives are users that are not interested in the game but are identified as committed by the predictive model: while we want both of these numbers to be low, minimizing the number of false positives is slightly more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 1 fared the best out of the three, showing that using playtime and the number of sessions was the best way to predict commitment based on the available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "No correlation was found between commitment and age of player, time of day during sessions, or day of the week during their sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "We began this project by asking whether commitment could be operationalized. The results - while promising - show that measuring the interest of particpants is a complex task, and a truly accurate model would require a large volume of training data as well as information about a player's initial commitment to function well. There are no easy pieces of identity which can be algorithmically converted into predictions: individuals are too complex for their behaviours to be prognostically categorized by demographic data such as age, gender, or experience. Perhaps using a multi-variable classification model would improve on prediction accuracy when dealing with a complicated, multifaceted task such as this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why Model 1 performed better than the models reliant on return rate is likely due to the connection between its variables and our definition of a \"committed player\". A player that has contributed more sessions and more hours to the research likely played over a longer period of time (rather than cramming). It is unfortunate that the models based on return rate didn't fare as well, since if they had, we would need less data and could potentially make accurate predictions about a player from the first week alone. However, this would require us to make two assumptions, the second of which is a glaring issue underlying our entire report: firstly, we would need to assume that the player would keep up a consistent, routine rate going forward, and secondly, we would need to assume that they would *remain* committed once the excitement of the first few weeks wore off.\n",
    " \n",
    "Nevertheless, we achieved our goal of creating a sleek classification model that could gage commitment based on past participation, which would be helpful for quickly identifying determined participants who might be interested in helping with future research, among other uses. "
